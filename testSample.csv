dewprisms,1420070401,gtgtif a woman wants to give up a child for adoption with a named father she is unable to do so without the father's consent.gtthat is easy enough to do. simply don't name the father.women are only not financially responsible if there is no named father. if the father isn't named he's not on the hook for child support either so it doesn't matter.you're deliberately removing context and responding to sentences that go together to form an overall argument separately in a way that does not make sense. at this point you're being intentionally misleading to twist this into what you want it to be instead of actually participating in the spirit of the argument. ,17,changemyview,663

[british architectural]([] critic [reyner banham]([] adapted the term into brutalism (originally new brutalism) to identify the emerging style.gtbrutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients with numerous examples in britain france germany japan the united states canada brazil the philippines and australia. examples are typically massive in character (even when not large) [fortresslike]([] with a predominance of exposed [concrete]([] construction or in the case of the brick brutalists ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. there is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the wholesite plan the main functions and peopleflows of the buildings. brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings) but was relatively rare for corporate projects. brutalism became favoured for many government projects highrise housing and [shopping centres]([] to create an architectural image that communicated strength functionality and frank expression of materiality.gtin its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness optimism and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. in one critical appraisal by banham brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. brutalism as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. more recently brutalism has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular  as a synonym for brutal  making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.gtgt[image]([] [(i)]([]  hubert h. humphrey building headquarters of the u.s. department of health and human services washington d. c.interesting [the michener institute]([]  [regenstein library]([]  [bradfield hall]([]  [murray d. lincoln campus center]([] parent commenter can [toggle nsfw](messagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectautowikibot nsfw toggleampmessage2btogglensfwcnas92m) or[](or) [delete](messagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectautowikibot deletionampmessage2bdeletecnas92m). will also delete on comment score of 1 or less.

slapchopsuey,1420070408,are those polyester bellbottom overalls? also looking at the color pattern of nick nolte's disco overalls on the right they should have had both of these guys wearing them (with eddie murphy wearing a brown shiny nylon dress shirt to compliment the beige shiny nylon dress shirt of nick nolte). that would show that the overalls  could work for either of the two featured skin colors. it would be a very 1970 thing to do hitting the nexus point between progressive blunt and awkward. ,7,TheWayWeWere,484

irisflame,1420070409,bugs i've noticed since the patch that really piss me off clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere. random invisible walls blocking shots when i have a clear line of sight. happened twice yesterday when i was using the sasr. once was under a bridge and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. both times i had nothing blocking my view but when i fired i would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated i'd shot a wall. wtf? severe server lag. i'm talking dying to people after i've killed them. i also killed somebody with an em6 after i had already died and switched loadouts to a gd7f. movement seems warpy people moving extra fast. it feels as though the server is trying to catch up and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast.  been having the cloak glitch a lot. when infil it gets stuck in this weird halfcloaked phase and i can't tell if i'm really cloaked or not. on ha i occasionally get stuck glowing even when my shield is off. invisible people. many invisible people. and no i'm not talking about infils. i'm sure there's more i just can't remember them.,7,Planetside,1307

Ezekiiel,1420070410,the league cup is contested by all teams in the english football league system (pl championship leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from august to february. the semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into extra time and penalties if required.the fa cup is contested by every professional football club in both england and wales and it runs from august to may. however the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the first round (which is called the first round proper) which is where the leagues 1 and 2 sides enter. eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the championship and pl sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in third round proper). matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example united vs arsenal ends 11 at old trafford the replay is at the emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties. unlike the league cup there is no two legged semi final. the semi final is played at wembley with the final also played at wembley. long post but there you go. the league cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why sunderland swansea bradford cardiff and birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the fa cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.  ,24,soccer,1407

elliebug,1420070416,i got pregnant when i was 18 and actually had my son only a couple of weeks after turning 19. it sounds like you have an amazing support system which makes all the difference! i've found that being a young mom is pretty nice because you have the energy now to keep up with the demands of a child. as someone who's been in your situation i can offer some consolation! it's not that bad! pm me if you need someone to talk to.,2,BabyBumps,423
gynx112,1420070416,2. 10 is the end of a cycle so i'd tie up loose ends and look for what inspires you with a clear head. 3. definitely look around at better options! they are there! 4. enjoy your health but don't overindulge. every choice you make effects you down the road. i'd say this card is telling you to work on your health more and enjoy the benefits of the life changes. as far as the chariot i'd think maybe its an authority figure or a goal you're working towards. is going to be difficult overcome but with the towers destruction also comes beginnings. ,1,tarot,547

modzer0,1420070421,it's a really good printer but not without it's own issues.  the biggest irritation to me was pla leaking from the hotend but a fan duct printed and installed that put airflow across the heat sink on the head fixed the issue.you can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the taz is frustration yet in the end they're glad they went with it.  once you do find the sweet spot though it's a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 247.  in fact lulzbot prints 245 with over a hundred of them.  as ujebba said in another thread there's a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer.  i'm sure the taz 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend.i can't say anything really bad about makerbot's 22x.  they have their own issues but once you work on them a bit they're solid workhorses.  the 5th gens... stay away for now.makergear m2 is a really solid printer.  i know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhub's guide the printer is very well liked.a printer i would highly suggest is an ultimaker 2.  it has a smaller build volume than the taz but it's far less picky with settings.  it's my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels.  with ninjaflex and composite ninjaflexabs parts the taz wins hands down though.if you can accept the build volume the flashforge creator pro is a nice choice and very well built.  any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site.  it doesn't hold your hand when it comes to documentation though.,2,3Dprinting,1693

Dortmunder1,1420070422,i would ditch the pulse laser personally. if you're good enough to hit with a rail gun effectively i would toss another fixed weapon on your second fire group.the pulse laser on the same fire group as your beam is probably dragging your beam down.do you run with full power to weapons when you're firing the beam?also if you want to make much less trips back for ammo just try a 1 bl 2 mc setup. or depending on how you fly you can bnz with 3 heavy thermal weapons.rush in dump all your weapon energy on the ship fly out and recharge repeat. if they start to jump just use all your energy on a constant stream from your main beam.,1,EliteDangerous,630

nobervu,1420070427,i didn't say anything about present day dungeons in what you were responding to (despite me believing that).  i said 2.0 runs.  my initial post said they destroy them in speed runs which they do from what i've seen.  if you parse in the latest extreme dungeons whm is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  my runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled sch's in game.  if i wasn't at work i'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests but i'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  the best new dungeon to speed run is qarn imho.  the worst being snowcloak (due to constant forced stops).and while i'm not saying it's impossible i never saw a group with sch instead of whm clear faster than 1011 minutes in wp back then.  compared to 815 runs and 730 runs by fcmates that's about three minutes.,-3,ffxiv,917

Jewbilant,1420070428,i don't know what sort of universe you live in but i know of nobody that has made that argument. but comparisons of israel to nazi germany attempts to designate zionism as racism and the application of different different standards for israel amp the rest of the world is all too common. the largest international body in the world is guilty of this. you can criticize israel and nobody (well maybe some guy on the internet but nobody prominent) thinks that's antisemitic. ,9,PoliticalDiscussion,473

SyrioForel,1420070432,so let me put it to you this way... right now you're looking at a highend overclockable cpu (which you're spending extra for by the way without buying a cooler!?) and to go along with that you're buying a shit lowend video card. so the result of that is that this cpu is going to just sit there and go to waste while the video card will be huffing and puffing straining at the seams.drop the cpu down to a nonoverclock i54460 or 4590 and bump the video card up to at least a radeon r9 280 or 280x and you'll be playing every modernday game at a smooth 60 fps on highultra settings  for nearly the same price. if you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself you'd be lucky if you got 3040 fps on high and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to medium to stay above 3040 (which is a minimum by any pc gaming standard). of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates but do you really want to limit yourself like that? surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about 120130 for a highquality ips led) and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it.if your intention is to play video games on this pc you're making a big mistake. i urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance. you don't need to sacrifice a quadcore processor just don't be getting the most expensive one of the bunch it doesn't fit the rest of your specs.anyway... good luck.,0,buildapc,1508

kanmax92,1420070433,i was going to do a writeup on the state of out of body shields like frost's globe eximus mobile globe and the nullifiers shields. these abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game. i've been running massive amounts of t4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become. however this is also because i have high rof weapons in my t4 load out. the nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled globes. this means explosive munitions i.e. penta nades ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players. or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it. another thing de should consider is removing the damage limit on shields. its pretty ridiculous how high rof weapons are better against nullifier shields (i've noticed this is only on nullifiers) that slow high damage weapons. to put this into perspective my boltor prime shoots spikes that deal 800 damage to the nullifier shields. my opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag 5 shots (9 shots with multishot) to take the shield down. de needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high rof and slow rof weapons to be viable.an idea i've been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs. blast procs can cc enemies inside the shield while magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself. by introducing this mechanic void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons.tldr 1) unify rules with regard to out of body shields. players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own.2) remove damage limit on shields to make slow rof weapons viable against nullifiers.3) add elemental weaknesses to the shields bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void.,2,Warframe,2007

ChessClue,1420070436,first of all thanks a bunch for the detailed response i'm extremely glad to hear you liked my cards.i deliberately made arcane unraveling do nothing in aggressive matchups (although technically it could net value with mad scientist) because i think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue. all the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control but 5 additional cards 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue seems absolutely insane to me. also this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with secrets and have mad scientistesque effects into the game. i'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card but i think against control it could be insanely useful.i think shadow summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all you pay 9 mana just to get the first shadow bomber on board (6 for the card 2 for hero power 1 for the bomber) and you can only hero power once per turn. if you have pressure to go along with it then yes it will do work but on its own i don't think it's that strong at all.for tinkerer i imagined this card less as a jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a minigazlowe. i think if you even have two cards on board that generate spare parts (like a gnome and yeti) and you trade them in this card gives you value. two extra spare parts with gazlowe or antonidas or even auctioneer is really good and you're not paying too much to get them. beastmaster can have synergy with hunter cards obviously allowing you to houndmaster anything enable kill command etc. etc. this can let you do stuff like turn 4 yeti turn 5 beastmaster  houndmaster or turn 3 harvest golem turn 4 coin beastmaster houndmaster basically it allows a workaround for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. it also synergizes with druid of the fang i don't know if that's enough to make beast druid viable but i think it's worth considering. and the most important part for me it is a vastly superior black knight  mark of the wild with hemet nesingwary a 6 mana assassinate that also summons a 63 and a 21. generator is insane if you can get value from it but you have to run the paladin secrets in exchange which are pretty mediocre. and they won't get amazing value with the board state except for avenge redemption will be bad if they kill the generator noble sacrifice won't be spectacular and the other ones will be garbage as usual.i'll agree that shadowy archer is too strong do you think making it a 12 would be fine (still better than creeper but it is a class card)?for the tortoise it does seem limited but i think in a deck with a lot of card draw or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws playing 22s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. a comparison could be made with hogger in terms of how 22 taunts can snowball out of control. also it's a beast though i don't know how useful that is.i didn't consider the shade comparison with fel imp at all i think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker when making it i was thinking of the synergy with floating watcher you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. also with blood imp on board he grows faster than shade as well although not by much. he's probably a much worse play in the early game but i think when you can play him and a few healthbuffing effects immediately he shines.for neighborhood blacksmith i think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. and if you only get a few more charges then he's pretty comparable to greenskin  with 1 minion he's just worse with 2 it's arguable (11 on the weapon but 2 attack) so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better greenskin. which for current warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.thanks again for the response!,1,customhearthstone,3903

magicthomson,1420070438,oh my goodness... that's so unfortunate. i did notice two days ago that you and iwhistle relapsed and i genuinely hoped we'd be killing it. then i saw hechmaturgic now...look. i'm eleven days in and i am committed but that does not mean that you can fucking give up on me. gtwe're failed except you.you've only failed if you give up nofap. i'd like to post something that i posted on pornfreewell i had been on a 7 day streak then i gave up. i was still motivated so i started again and went on a 22 day. then i began doubting myself and what i was doing. i watched a few films in that streak and found myself enjoying scenes of sex more than usual. this caused it to snowball.what helped immensely from that streak (my longest) is when an arousing thought hits you immediately shut it down. don't try to ignore it but rather tell it to fuck off and this next step is key to shutting it down move away from your previous roomactivity and do something else.if you disagree with the thought but don't move away it'll be like a drug addict telling himself he's going to the store when he's actually heading towards a trap housedrug house.  i know myself better than anybody else. i find it hard to really register others' feelings when they're trying to motivate me so i made a video where i convince myself in a time of need to move on. this is both to prevent procrastination and watching porn i leave my phone across my room. others choose to keep it across the house or in their safe but this is sufficient for me. i use an alarm and it forces me to stand up. once i am up i won't go back. lastly reward and recognise your achievements! make a vague reward plan. after a week of my new life i will treat myself to a mcflurry. on the second i'll get a subway sandwich. on the third a cinema visit and fourth a new trouser. something like that never forget to reread your goals. never become complacent. i look forward to seeing our counters rise together as we create a new life for ourselves.oh and happy new yearit is literally 0000 as i type this.i want to see you here next year at 365 days with me,1,NoFap,2102

RestarttGaming,1420070442,hey!i get your point.  unfortunately i think you either responded to the wrong topic or got confused  this post was about tight rulesets not about balance but you seem to use those interchangably.  you can make tight rules with an unbalanced system or a balanced system with not tight rules.if it was about balance well warmachinehordes is one system that supports 14 full factions and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  so the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 1618 factions really breaks the camels back there but i cant see it.but back to the tight ruleset   warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  it's not the minute rules interactions.  really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.a systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing leading to confusion.40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.to use an example earlier today  a single passenger can fire out of each fire point.  this is a poor rule as it stands because the timing is not defined and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you fire psychic shooting attacks?  are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?a tighter defined rules set would have defined fire as making a ranged attack and ranged attacks as psychic shooting etc.  it would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.to use an example from a comprehensive ruleset in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  in 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads all blue lands produce an extra mana.  that would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  theres just a lot of problems with that wording you know this without even playtesting it.thats why magic words it until end of turn whenever a player taps an island for mana that player adds blue to his or her mana pool   the timing is defined tap is a defined term in the rules everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.just reading through different games' rulesets you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  it's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules it's the way they are written.,1,Warhammer40k,3276

RowdyGorgonite,1420070446,i really feel like this shouldn't all be put on the op. the roommate should also be held accountable for leaving her puppy unattended. obviously no one expects something like this to happen but puppies have no concept of social cues and can get into trouble suuuper easily (and not just with other dogs). if the roommate wasn't watching the puppy the puppy should have been someplace safe where it wouldn't get into trouble (chewing on inappropriate items going potty inside etc). similarly op should have crated his own dog if he knew charlie had a history of snapping or knew that the puppy would be left unattended with him.i'm not saying by any means that it's all the roommate's fault but these were two dogs that should not have been alone with each other and both owners failed to keep them separated. should he help out with bills? probably yeah. but should he feel obligated to foot 100 of the expenses? i really don't think so.,-27,Dogtraining,937

ufcarazy,1420070450,no organism is imaginary is my point.  we assume homo sapiens do not want their lives ended unless they explicitly say so.  the reason people oppose abortion is because they believe the organism being aborted is a homo sapien and if it is a homo sapien then abortion is murder which is something libertarians oppose.  the reason people oppose abortion is not because god said it is bad.  therefore the criticism against the opposition to abortion is itself based on something imaginary  a belief either no one or practically no one has.even if people believed that abortion was wrong simply because god said it was wrong then that still would not justify opposing laws against abortion because otherwise we would have to oppose laws against murder given there are people who support laws against murder due to god saying it is wrong.,1,Libertarian,833

Argueforthesakeofit,1420070451,gtin the communist manifesto marx predicted imminent revolution in europe.[] also predicted it in advanced countries. not only has this not happened over 100 years later but when attempted it was in backwards feudal countries. the attempts resulted in class based authoritarian command economies that failed.the manifesto summarised their analysis the big battles between the feudal order and the bourgeoisie were imminent1848 was a year of revolutions in europe.in 1871 the paris commune was founded.the russian revolution started in russia's industrial centers moscow and st petersburg and this is where bolshevicks had support. in the country side other socialists were far more popular.at the same time there is an uprising or riots or whatever in germany that is put down by spd at the time an officialy marxist party.marxism never really caught on in the anglosaxon world (there were cases when socialists would get up to 5 or 6 of the vote followed by red scares see eugene debbs or read the grapes of wrath for a closer look at that era) and it then got mixed with the anticolonial movement that flourished in many less developed countries with economies based on agriculture.but it's wrong to say that it applies on feudalism. even today with communist parties far weaker in general you see them getting strong in industrial centers in a number of european countries.,1,worldnews,1376
